# Home-Sight-AI

# Overview
This repository contains code for an AI-powered Real Estate Assistant application. Built using Streamlit and Google Gemini, it delivers intelligent property-related insights by integrating real-time retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, offering accurate market analysis and trends through a sleek, user-friendly interface.

# Abstract
This project utilizes generative AI and retrieval techniques to answer real estate-related queries in real time. By augmenting user prompts with domain-specific property information, the system provides clear, actionable insights for investors, homeowners, and agents. Custom CSS enhances the UI, while Gemini LLM ensures high-quality responses.

# Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop an AI assistant that can:

  - Answer real estate questions with up-to-date market insights.

  - Provide investment advice, rental trends, mortgage rate context, and development news.

  - Present intelligent, context-aware responses using large language models.

  - Deliver results with a polished user interface using a modern CSS theme.

# Problem Statement
Real estate data is scattered across various platforms, often requiring manual filtering and deep understanding to extract meaningful insights. This assistant addresses the challenge by consolidating and summarizing complex information using AI to support better, faster decision-making.

# Motivation
- **Market Intelligence:** Empower users with clear, AI-generated real estate insights.

- **Accessibility:** Deliver real-time responses in a conversational format.

- **Design-Focused UX:** Provide a clean, modern interface using custom CSS.

- **Domain-Specific RAG:** Enhance LLM output with curated real estate knowledge.

- **Scalability:** Extendable to other domains (e.g., finance, travel, healthcare).

- **Innovation:** Combines retrieval, generation, and UI/UX in a unified experience.

# Key Features
- **LLM Integration:** Uses Gemini Pro for intelligent answer generation.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Fuses static real estate data with user prompts.

- **Real-Time Query Handling:** Responds instantly to user queries.

- **Custom Styling:** Applies tailored CSS for a clean and professional UI.

- **Structured Responses:** Uses markdown containers for organized output.

- **Insightful Coverage:** Covers topics like investment, architecture, rental markets, urban planning, and more.

# Technologies Used
- Streamlit for the front-end UI

- Google Gemini API for LLM-based responses

- Python for app logic and integration

- dotenv for secure API key management

- Custom CSS for UI design and consistency

# Scalability & Future Work
This architecture can be scaled to support other domains or integrate APIs for live property listings, price predictions, or geospatial data visualization.
